	<p><strong>Web design, Assessment 2 – Critical report<br>
Malin Helene Andreassen – 0903842</strong><br><br>

The web site I have designed, this report is analysing, is a personal portfolio. The client I am designing for needs a web site for two reasons; She is going to apply for a university where an online portfolio is required in the application, and because she would like to be contacted by employers looking for freelancers. The goal of the page is to present a selected amount of the clients graphic designs and photographs, and have all necessary contact information available.<br><br>

To start the entire web design process, the first thing that needs to be done is to define the target audience. 
The target audience for this site is the clients advisor at the university and and men and women aged 25-50, who are working with design. In both these cases the audience will have much knowledge about how to use and navigate a web site.<br><br> 

Gergle(2002, p.55) makes a very good point when he says that: 
	“From a developer's point of view, an ideal situation would be one where every user has the 	same hardware and software and the most advanced possible version. This reduces 	testing... However, this simply isn't realistic” 
User's hardware and software configurations vary widely, which makes it important to test different configurations. A quite big problem for designers is that very many users are using systems and settings that the designer consider non-optical, either because they don't know how to change it or they prefer it that way. It isn't possible to change the users, so the solution is to simply understand the users and design for them.<br><br> 

The users on my clients site are probably mostly designers themselves, and therefore have the lates technology and the optical settings. This does however not mean that the site shouldn't be accessible for a normal user. 
Another very important point is that platform differences play an significant role when designing a site. A site can look one way in firefox, and then completely different in windows explorer 6 for example. And the site will most definitely look different on a smartphone.<br><br> 

The client wants a web site with a simple layout. The focus of the user should be on the clients work, with a too advanced and designed web site, the focus can easily be distracted from the content. All of the images used on this web site belongs to the clients, the client holds the copyright for all of the images.
The production plan I set up for the production was as following; <br>
 - Research<br>
 - Designing the web page (sketching wireframes and make a preview of the design in photoshop)<br>
 - Program the CSS<br>
 - Program the HTML and add all the content<br>
 - And lastly, fix all the bugs<br><br>

While doing research I looked through many different kinds of portfolios, both different in layout and colour. I also read a couple of articles online about web design. The most important resource has been the book Usability for the web; designing web sites that work by Darren Gergle. It has provided me with most of the knowledge I need before starting the actual programming. 
As a web designer, I find it easier to begin with the design and the layout of the site, that means I know exactly what to do during the programming process. I started sketching wireframes and looked at several online portfolios to get inspiration, among them are:<br><br>

<a href="http://www.bjornrostad.com/">http://www.bjornrostad.com/</a><br>
<a href="http://www.davidairey.com/portfolio/">http://www.davidairey.com/portfolio/</a><br>
<a href="http://www.attitudedesign.co.uk/portfolio/">http://www.attitudedesign.co.uk/portfolio/</a><br><br>

All of them uses white, black and grey, with white as background color. After much testing and redesign, I found out that it was easier to make it look better with darker colours, but still using white, black and grey. The navigation system I have chosen is a linear one at the righthand side of the page. It is easy to notice and easy to use. The navigation is a very important part of the page. Users are usually very impatient, they do not want to have to look for the navigation and they have to understand it quickly. If they don't, the user will loose interest and move on to another page. The navigation system for this page is as basic as it gets. But it is always in the users sight of view, and always in the same place with the same buttons. It is very user friendly, so the user can navigate quickly into what he or she is interested in.
I did a couple of wireframes and color testing in photoshop until I was satisfied with the design. Then the programming could begin.<br><br> </p>

<p>I have chosen a quite simple layout for the page, as earlier mentioned. Keeping the page structure simple allows the page to support the content. “A simple page ensures that page titles are recognized, that navigational elements are clearly for navigation and that the information contained within the page is salient to the user.” Gergle(2002, p.180). All the content is in the middle of the page, and is highlighted with a white area behind it. This is both to give more attention to the content, but also to avoid having too much grey and monotony.<br>  
To give the page a little more personality I decided to have a striped background. It gives the page more of a design without being distractive. The logo, which also is the back to home button, is in a hand written font. This adds more to the personality of the page, and makes it more human than is everything was to be computer generated. It is important to show the user that it is a person behind this page.<br> 
The colours I have chosen are simply grey and white. It gives the page a professional look. The images will add more color to the page, that way the page will not be a boring and colourless one. 
The hexadecimals for the colours are #FFF and #282724 on the background. The color on the text is #333 and #7A7A7A for all the links, including the navigation. I looked through many colour combinations at <a href="http://kuler.adobe.com/">http://kuler.adobe.com/</a>, but ended up finding my own combination in photoshop.
The background, however, is made up of a small, repeating 8x8px picture. Because of the small size, it has absolutely no problems of loading it. Anyhow, in case it should take too long time to load, the background colour is set to #333. That way the site will look just as normal, even without the striped background. <br><br>  

All the images my client provided me with are in a very high resolution, and some of the in very different sizes. All of them needed to be resized and saved for web. 
Since all the images was in different sizes, it was very difficult to make a good looking gallery. The original idea was to have a thumbnail gallery, where the user could click on an image and it would show a bigger version of it. This was impossible to achieve without the whole content moving a couple of pixels every time the image size changed. Neither with Dreamweaver or javascript could I  fix this problem, so instead I downloaded a jQuery script for image galleries and programmed it into my web page. I found the script at: <a href="http://leandrovieira.com/projects/jquery/lightbox/">http://leandrovieira.com/projects/jquery/lightbox/</a> 
There are other designers and artists who use this script at their web site as well, for example the swedish illustrator Anneli Olander;
<a href="http://www.anneliolander.com/portfolio/">http://www.anneliolander.com/portfolio/</a><br>
The only negative aspect of using the script is that all thumbnails must be pre-made.  It is not a problem itself, but it takes longer time. And every time a new image is added, a thumbnail must be added as well. Except that, it is a practical and beautiful way of presenting the pictures. 
This script opens up the picture on top of the web site, and it is possible to navigate between all the images at that site without having to close one image every time. <br><br>

The feedback facilities I have provided are links to my Facebook and Twitter accounts, my email adress for longer and more personal contact. In addition I have also added a contact form. This will encourage people to send a feedback right then and there instead of having to open up their emails or switch window. A form makes it much easier and  faster to give feedback. <br><br>  

I have tested my web page in both Safari, Firefox and Internet Explorer 7. I tested the page in Safari and Firefox on a MacBook, and in IE on a Dell with Windows Vista. Everything seems to work very fine.  The links are working, and there is a clear correlation between links and content. All the images show up, and the jQuery gallery works in all browsers. My homepage is called index.html, and the other pages are named after the navigation. The HTML of the page has also been validated through the W3 XHTML validator, and all the errors have been corrected.<br>
All in all, this is a web site that works very well for its purpose. It is user friendly with a timeless design, and the focus is on the content. </p>
